# IncomePredictor-PCA-LogisticRegression

🎯 **Project Goal:**  
Build a machine learning model to predict whether a person's income exceeds $50K per year based on demographic and employment attributes using Logistic Regression and PCA.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project uses the **Adult Income Dataset** to perform binary classification (`<=50K` or `>50K`). The steps include:

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
- Encoding Categorical Features  
- Feature Scaling  
- Dimensionality Reduction using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**  
- Model Building using **Logistic Regression**  
- Evaluation using Accuracy Score and Variance Explained

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn (sklearn)

---

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Load and Inspect Data**  
2. **Handle Missing Values**  
3. **Encode Categorical Columns** (Label Encoding)  
4. **Scale Features** using StandardScaler  
5. **Apply PCA** to reduce dimensionality  
6. **Train a Logistic Regression model**  
7. **Evaluate Model Performance**

## 📊 Results

- 📈 **Accuracy with all features**: `~82.18%`  
- 🧠 **Optimal PCA Components**: `12 components preserve 90% variance`  
- 📉 **Accuracy after PCA with 12 features**: `~82.27%`
